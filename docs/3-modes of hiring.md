| **Strict Compliance Mode**        | Enterprise ATS + HR Legal Filters       | *“Will this resume be auto-rejected before a human sees it?”*  | Binary eligibility checks based only on **explicit JD requirements** | Missing mandatory skills, certifications, degree, location, visa, or large experience gaps | Potential, projects quality, clever wording, soft skills   | Applying to large enterprises, regulated roles, or when you want to test worst-case screening | Because some companies genuinely **cannot** move you forward if compliance fails      |
| **Real-World ATS Mode (Default)** | Modern ATS (Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby) | *“How competitive is my resume compared to others?”*           | Semantic skill matching + weighted relevance scoring                 | Poor alignment with core stack, weak experience signals, unclear role history              | Strict keyword counts, small year gaps, perfect formatting | Day-to-day job applications, resume iteration, ranking against peers                          | Because most resumes are **ranked, not rejected**, and recruiters decide from the top |
| **Brutal Signal Mode**            | Skeptical Hiring Manager / Interviewer  | *“If this reached an engineer, would they take me seriously?”* | Evidence-based scrutiny of **claims, metrics, scope, and depth**     | Vague bullets, no numbers, toy projects, inflated titles                                   | Compliance, formatting, HR constraints                     | Final resume polish, interview prep, senior/competitive roles                                 | Because engineers don’t trust resumes — they look for proof                           |
