    "# ### Phase 1: The Robot (ATS Agent)\n",
    "\n",

    "# 1. Extract Skills: Scan the resume for exact keyword matches from the JD.\n",
    "# 2. Check Filters: Verify hard requirements (e.g., \"Must have Bachelor's\", \"Must have 5 years exp\").\n",
    "# 3. Audit Formatting: Detect if the resume uses standard headers (Experience, Education). Flag complex tables or graphics that make parsing hard.\n",
