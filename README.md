# Welcome to InternOps

The **InternOps** project is an **AI-driven recruitment and career coaching ecosystem** designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and employers through **multi-stage resume analysis**. By simulating a **real-world hiring pipeline**, the platform utilizes **specialized agents** to provide "Cold and Logical" **ATS parsing** for keyword matching, **recruiter-level intuition** for career trajectory evaluation, and **engineering manager-style technical depth validation**. Ultimately, the project aims to **empower candidates**—specifically those seeking **AI and SDE internships**—by offering **actionable feedback** and **automated application tools** to **reduce rejection rates** and **optimize professional profiles** for highly competitive roles.

### Key Components and Goals:

* **Resume Builder**: Modifies resumes based on specific **Job Descriptions (JD)** to increase the **selection percentage** for interviews.
* **Three-Phase Analysis**: Features a sequential screening process consisting of an **ATS Agent**, a **Technical Recruiter Agent**, and a **Hiring Manager Agent**.
* **Agentic AI Chat**: Provides a **conversational interface** for users to interact with the system.
* **Automated Applications**: Aims to implement **automatic application** features to streamline the job search process.
* **Simulation Modes**: Includes modes like **Strict Compliance**, **Real-World ATS**, and **Brutal Signal** to test resumes against different levels of hiring scrutiny.
* **Internship Database**: Maintains a **master list of high-tier internships** (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Uber) with eligibility and timeline data.
