Showcase strong technical communication skills, perhaps through links to technical blogs, workshops, or presentations. Ensure your resume directly addresses keywords like 'prompt engineering' and 'fine-tuning/PEFT concepts' if you have experience with them, and mention familiarity with various LLMs beyond Gemini, such as Open AI, LLaMA, or Mistral. Tailor your summary and experience to reflect a passion for educating and guiding others in AI, rather than solely focusing on building systems for an SDE/AI internship."}}
